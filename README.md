### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

I'm the founder & developer of **[Pallyy](https://pallyy.com)** which I've been working on for the last 3.5 years. Pallyy started as a side project but has now grown to a point it's my day job, and main focus. 

I manage a few other small SaaS platforms, and constantly work on building new and exciting things. I love working with NuxtJS & MongoDB for all my new projects. Here's a list of what I'm working on now:

- ðŸ“… **[Pallyy](https://pallyy.com)**, a social media management platform
- ðŸ§µ **[Thread Creator](https://threadcreator.com)**, a Twitter scheduling tool
- ðŸ§¾ **[Diary](https://diary.sh)**, A simple, collaborative note taking app
