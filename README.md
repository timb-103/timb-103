### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

I'm the founder & developer of **[Pallyy](https://pallyy.com)** which I've been working on for the last 3.5 years. Pallyy started as a side project but has now grown to a point it's my day job, and main focus. 

I manage a few other small SaaS platforms, and constantly work on building new and exciting things. I love working with NuxtJS & MongoDB for all my new projects. Here's a list of what I'm working on now:

- **[Pallyy](https://pallyy.com)**, a social media management platform
- **[Thread Creator](https://threadcreator.com)**, a Twitter scheduling tool
- **[Diary](https://diary.sh)**, A simple, collaborative note taking app
- **[README](https://readme.site)**, host your Github README on it's own page

Plus some of my favourite open source projects:

- [nuxt-emoji](https://github.com/timb-103/nuxt-emoji)
- [nuxt-modal](https://github.com/timb-103/nuxt-modal)
- [nuxt-mongodb](https://github.com/timb-103/nuxt-mongodb)
- [nuxt-rate-limit](https://github.com/timb-103/nuxt-rate-limit)

You can find me on [X](https://x.com/timb03), or via email tim103@pm.me.
