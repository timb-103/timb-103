### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

I'm the founder and sole developer of a social media management platform called [Pallyy](https://pallyy.com) which I've been working on for the last 3.5 years. It started as a side project but has now grown to a point it's my day job, and main focus. 

I manage a few other small SaaS platforms, and constantly work on building new and exciting things. I love working with @nuxtjs & @mongoDB for all my new projects.

Here's a list of my current projects:

- [Pallyy](https://pallyy.com), a social media management platform
- [Thread Creator](https://threadcreator.com), a Twitter scheduling tool
- [Diary](https://diary.sh), A simple, collaborative note taking app
